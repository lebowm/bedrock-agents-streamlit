## Overview

In this project, we will set up an Amazon Bedrock agent with an action group that dynamically creates an investment company portfolio based on specific parameters. The agent also has Q&A capabilities for Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reports, leveraging a Streamlit framework for the user interface. Additionally, this exercise includes a method for sending emails, although the email functionality will not be fully configured.

For those who prefer an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) solution, we provide an AWS CloudFormation template that will deploy most of the necessary resources, including S3 buckets, an action group, and a Lambda function. You will still need to manually create the knowledge base with the already provided resources, but the steps are relatively straightforward. If you would like to deploy this workflow via **AWS CloudFormation**, please refer to the workshop guide [here](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/f8a7a3f8-1603-4b10-95cb-0b471db272d8/en-US/module7-deploy-cfn/index-en-9).

Alternatively, this README will walk you through the step-by-step process to set up the Amazon Bedrock agent manually using the AWS Console.

## Prerequisites

- An active AWS Account.
- Familiarity with AWS services like Amazon Bedrock, S3, Lambda, and Cloud9.

## Configuration and Setup

### Step 1: Creating S3 Buckets

- Please make sure that you are in the **us-west-2** region. If another region is required, you will need to update the region variable `theRegion` in the `invoke_agent.py` file code.
- **Domain Data Bucket**: Create an S3 bucket to store the domain data. For example, call the S3 bucket `knowledgebase-bedrock-agent-{alias}`. We will use the default settings.

![Bucket create 1](images/bucket_pic_1.png)

![Bucket create 2](images/bucket_pic_2.png)

- Next, we will download the domain data from [here](https://github.com/lebowm/bedrock-agents-streamlit). On your computer, open terminal or command prompt, and run the following `curl` commands to download the data:

- Also, you have the option to download the .pdf files from [here](https://github.com/build-on-aws/bedrock-agents-streamlit/tree/main/S3docs). These files will download to your **Documents** folder. Upload these files to S3 bucket `knowledgebase-bedrock-agent-{alias}`. These files are the Federal Open Market Committee documents describing monetary policy decisions made at the Federal Reserved board meetings. The documents include discussions of economic conditions, policy directives to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for open market operations, and votes on the federal funds rate. More information can be found [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20231011a.htm). Once uploaded, please select one of the documents to open and review the content.

### Step 2: Knowledge Base Setup in Bedrock Agent

- Before we setup the knowledge base, we will need to grant access to the models that will be needed for our Bedrock agent. Navigate to the Amazon Bedrock console, then on the left of the screen, scroll down and select **Model access**. On the right, select the orange **Manage model access** button.

![Model access](images/model_access.png)

- Select the checkbox for the base model columns **Amazon: Titan Embeddings G1 - Text** and **Anthropic: Claude 3 Haiku**. This will provide you access to the required models. After, scroll down to the bottom right and select **Request model access**.

- After, verify that the Access status of the Models are green with **Access granted**.

![Access granted](images/access_granted.png)

- Now, we will create a knowledge base by selecting **Knowledge base** on the left, then selecting the orange button **Create knowledge base**.

![create_kb_btn](images/create_kb_btn.png)

- You can use the default name, or enter in your own. Then, select **Next** at the bottom right of the screen.

![KB details](images/kb_details.gif)

- Sync S3 bucket `knowledgebase-bedrock-agent-{alias}` to this knowledge base.

![KB setup](images/KB_setup.png)

- For the embedding model, choose **Amazon: Titan Embeddings G1 - Text**. Leave the other options as default, and scroll down to select **Next**.

![Vector Store Config](/static/vector_store_config.gif)

- On the next screen, review your work, then select **Create knowledge base**
  (Creating the knowledge base may take a few minutes. Please wait for it to finish before going to the next step.)

![Review and Create KB](images/review_create_kb.png)

- When the knowledge base is complete, you will see a green message at the top similar to the following:

![kb complete](images/kb_complete.png)

### Step 3: Lambda Function Configuration

- Create a Lambda function (Python 3.12) for the Bedrock agent's action group. We will call this Lambda function `Legalese-actions`.

![Create Function](images/create_function.png)

![Create Function2](images/create_function2.png)

- Copy the python code provided below, or from the file [here](https://github.com/build-on-aws/bedrock-agents-streamlit/blob/main/ActionLambda.py) into your Lambda function.

```python
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    print(event)

    def companyResearch(event):
        companyName = get_named_parameter(event, 'name').lower()
        print("NAME PRINTED: ", companyName)

        for company_info in company_data:
            if company_info["companyName"].lower() == companyName:

        return None

    def createPortfolio(event, company_data):

```

- Then, select **Deploy** in the tab section of the Lambda console. Review the code provided before moving to the next step. You will see that we are using mock data to represent various companies in the technology and real estate insdustry, along with functions that we will call later in this workshop.

![Lambda deploy](images/lambda_deploy.png)

- Next, apply a resource policy to the Lambda to grant Bedrock agent access. To do this, we will switch the top tab from **code** to **configuration** and the side tab to **Permissions**. Then, scroll to the **Resource-based policy statements** section and click the **Add permissions** button.

![Permissions config](images/permissions_config.png)

![Lambda resource policy create](images/lambda_resource_policy_create.png)

- Select **_AWS service_**, then use the following settings to configure the resource based policy:

* **_Service_** - `Other`
* **_Statement ID_** - `allow-bedrock-agent`
* **_Principal_** - `bedrock.amazonaws.com`
* **_Source ARN_** - `arn:aws:bedrock:us-west-2:{account-id}:agent/*` - (Please note, AWS recommends least privilage so only an allowed agent can invoke this Lambda function. A \* at the end of the ARN grants any agent in the account access to invoke this Lambda. Ideally, we would not use this in a production environment.)
* **_Action_** - `lambda:InvokeFunction`

![Lambda resource policy](images/lambda_resource_policy.png)

- Once your configurations look similar to the above screenshot, select **_Save_** at the bottom.

- Next, we will adjust the configuration on the Lambda so that it has enough time, and CPU to handle the request. Navigate back to the Lambda function screen, go to the **_Configurations_** tab, then **_General configuration_** and select Edit.

![Lambda config 1](images/lambda_config.png)

- Update **_Memory_** to **1024MB**, and **_Timeout_** to **1 minute**. Leave the other settings as default, then select **_Save_**.

![Lambda config 2](images/lambda_config_2.png)

### Step 4: Setup Bedrock Agent and Action Group

- Navigate to the Bedrock console. Go to the toggle on the left, and under **_Builder tools_** select **_Agents_**. Provide an agent name, like **_Legalese_** then create the agent.

- The agent description is optional, and we will use the default new service role. For the model, select **Anthropic: Claude 3 Haiku**. Next, provide the following instruction for the agent:

```instruction
You are an investment analyst. Your job is to assist in investment analysis, create research summaries, generate profitable company portfolios, and facilitate communication through emails. Here is how I want you to think step by step:

1. Portfolio Creation:
    Analyze the user's request to extract key information such as the desired number of companies and industry.
    Based on the criteria from the request, create a portfolio of companies. Use the template provided to format the portfolio.

2. Company Research and Document Summarization:
    For each company in the portfolio, conduct detailed research to gather relevant financial and operational data.
    When a document, like the FOMC report, is mentioned, retrieve the document and provide a concise summary.

3. Email Communication:
    Using the email template provided, format an email that includes the newly created company portfolio and any summaries of important documents.
    Utilize the provided tools to send an email upon request, That includes a summary of provided responses and portfolios created.
```

- After, scroll to the top and **Save**

- The instructions for the Generative AI Investment Analyst Tool outlines a comprehensive framework designed to assist in investment analysis. This tool is tasked with creating tailored portfolios of companies based on specific industry criteria, conducting thorough research on these companies, and summarizing relevant financial documents. Additionally, the tool formats and sends professional emails containing the portfolios and document summaries. The process involves continuous adaptation to user feedback and maintaining a contextual understanding of ongoing requests to ensure accurate and efficient responses.

- Next, we will add an action group. Scroll down to `Action groups` then select **_Add_**.

- Call the action group `Legalese-actions`. We will set the `Action group type` to **_Define with API schemas_**. `Action group invocations` should be set to **_select an existing Lambda function_**. For the Lambda function, select `Legalese-actions`.

- For the `Action group Schema`, we will choose **_Define via in-line schema editor_**. Replace the default schema in the **In-line OpenAPI schema** editor with the schema provided below. You can also retrieve the schema from the repo [here](https://github.com/build-on-aws/bedrock-agent-txt2sql/blob/main/schema/athena-schema.json). After, select **_Add_**.
  `(This API schema is needed so that the bedrock agent knows the format structure and parameters needed for the action group to interact with the Lambda function.)`

![ag creation](images/ag_creation.gif)

- This API schema defines three primary endpoints, `/companyResearch`, `/createPortfolio`, and `/sendEmail` detailing how to interact with the API, the required parameters, and the expected responses.
  ![advance_prompt_btn](images/advance_prompt_btn.png)

- Now, we need to provide the Bedrock agent a prompt that are examples of a formatted response for an investment company portfolio, and email. In the creation of an agent, it's initially configured with four foundational prompt templates for **_pre-processing_**, **_orchestration_**, **_knowledge base response generation_**, and **_post-processing_**. These prompts guide how the agent interacts with the foundation model across various steps of the process. These templates are crucial for processing user inputs, orchestrating the flow between the foundation model, action groups, and knowledge bases, as well as formatting the responses sent to users. By customizing these templates and incorporating advanced prompts or few-shot examples, you can significantly improve the agent's precision and performance in handling specific tasks. More information on advanced prompting for an agent can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/advanced-prompts.html). Additionally, there is an option to use a [custom parser Lambda function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/lambda-parser.html) for more granular formatting.

- Next, scroll down to **Advanced prompts** and select **Edit**.

![advance_prompt_btn](images/advance_prompt_btn.png)

- Select the **Builder tools** tab. Toggle on the radio button **Override orchestration template defaults**. Make sure **Activate orchestration template** is enabled as well.

- In the **_Prompt template editor_**, scroll down to line 22-23, then copy/paste in the following portfolio example and email format:

```sql
Here is an example of a company portfolio.

<portfolio_example>

Here is a portfolio of the top 3 real estate companies:

  1. NextGenPast Residences with revenue of $180,000, expenses of $22,000 and profit of $158,000 employing 260 people.

  2. GlobalRegional Properties Alliance with revenue of $170,000, expenses of $21,000 and profit of $149,000 employing 11 people.

  3. InnovativeModernLiving Spaces with revenue of $160,000, expenses of $20,000 and profit of $140,000 employing 10 people.

</portfolio_example>

Here is an example of an email formatted.

<email_format>

Company Portfolio:

  1. NextGenPast Residences with revenue of $180,000, expenses of $22,000 and profit of $158,000 employing 260 people.

  2. GlobalRegional Properties Alliance with revenue of $170,000, expenses of $21,000 and profit of $149,000 employing 11 people.

  3. InnovativeModernLiving Spaces with revenue of $160,000, expenses of $20,000 and profit of $140,000 employing 10 people.


FOMC Report:

  Participants noted that recent indicators pointed to modest growth in spending and production. Nonetheless, job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate remained low. Inflation had eased somewhat but remained elevated.

  Participants recognized that Russia’s war against Ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship and was contributing to elevated global uncertainty. Against this background, participants continued to be highly attentive to inflation risks.
</email_format>
```

- The results should look similar to the following:

![advance_prompt_setup](images/advance_prompt_setup.gif)

- Scroll to the bottom and select the **_Save and exit_** button.

- Now, check to confirm that the **_Orchestration_** in the **_Advance prompt_** section is Overridden.

![advance_prompt_overridden](images/adv_prompt_overridden.png)

### Step 5: Setup Knowledge Base with Bedrock Agent

- While on the Bedrock agent console, scroll down to **_Knowledge base_** and select Add. When integrating the KB with the agent, you will need to provide basic instructions on how to handle the knowledge base. For example, use the following:

  ```text
  Use this knowledge base when a user asks about data, such as economic trends, company financial statements, or the outcomes of the Federal Open Market Committee meetings.
  ```

![Knowledge base add2](images/add_knowledge_base2.png)

- Review your input, then select **_Add_**.

- Scroll to the top and select **_Prepare_** so that the changes made are updated. Then select **_Save and exit_**.

### Step 6: Create an alias

- Create an alias (new version), and choose a name of your liking. After it's done, make sure to copy your **Alias ID** and **Agent ID**. You will need this in step 8.

![Create alias](images/create_alias.png)

## Step 7: Testing the Setup

### Testing the Knowledge Base

- While in the Bedrock console, select **_Knowledge base_** under the **Builder tools** tab, then the KB you created. Scroll down to the Data source section, and make sure to select the **Sync** button.

![KB sync](images/kb_sync.png)

- You will see a user interface on the right where you will need to select a model. Choose the **Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku model**, then select **Apply**.

![Select model test](images/select_model_test.png)

- You should now have the ability to enter prompts in the user interface provided.

![KB prompt](images/kb_prompt.png)

- Test Prompts:
  ```text
  Give me a summary of financial market developments and open market operations in January 2023.
  ```
  ```text
  Can you provide information about inflation or rising prices?
  ```
  ```text
  What can you tell me about the Staff Review of the Economic & Financial Situation?
  ```

### Testing the Bedrock Agent

- While in the Bedrock console, select **_Agents_** under the **Builder tools** tab, then the agent you created. You should be able to enter prompts in the user interface provided to test your knowledge base and action groups from the agent.

![Agent test](images/agent_test.png)

- Example prompts for **Knowledge base**:

  ```text
  Give me a summary of financial market developments and open market operations in January 2023
  ```

  ```text
  Tell me the participants view on economic conditions and economic outlook
  ```

  ```text
  Provide any important information I should know about inflation, or rising prices
  ```

  ```text
  Tell me about the Staff Review of the Economic & financial Situation
  ```

- Example prompts for **Action groups**:

```text
  Create a portfolio with 3 companies in the real estate industry
```

```text
  Create portfolio of 3 companies that are in the technology industry
```

```text
  Create a new investment portfolio of companies
```

```text
  Do company research on TechStashNova Inc.
```

- Example prompt for KB & AG
  ```text
  Send an email to test@example.com that includes the company portfolio and FOMC summary
  ```
  `(The logic for this method is not implemented to send emails)`

## Step 8: Setup and Run Streamlit App on EC2 (Optional)

1. **Obtain CF template to launch the streamlit app**: Download the Cloudformation template from [here](https://github.com/build-on-aws/bedrock-agents-streamlit/blob/main/cfn/3-ec2-streamlit-template.yaml). This template will be used to deploy an EC2 instance that has the Streamlit code to run the UI. **_Please note, the CIDR range and VPC used in the CloudFormation template may need to be modified if the defined subnet and VPC are not applicable._**

2. **Deploy template via Cloudformation**:

   - In your mangement console, search, then go to the CloudFormation service.
   - Create a stack with new resources (standard)

   ![Create stack](images/create_stack.png)

   - Prepare template: Choose existing template -> Specify template: Upload a template file -> upload the template donaloaded from the previous step.

![Create stack config](images/create_stack_config.png)

- Next, Provide a stack name like **_ec2-streamlit_**. Keep the instance type on the default of t3.small, then go to Next.

![Stack details](images/stack_details.png)

- On the **_Configure stack options_** screen, leave every setting as default, then go to Next.

- Scroll down to the capabilities section, and acknowledge the warning message before submitting.

- Once the stack is complete, go to the next step.

![Stack complete](images/stack_complete.png)

3. **Edit the app to update agent IDs**:

   - Navigate to the EC2 instance management console. Under instances, you should see `EC2-Streamlit-App`. Select the checkbox next to it, then connect to it via `EC2 Instance Connect`.

   ![ec2 connect clip](images/ec2_connect.gif)

- If you see a message that says **EC2 Instance Connect service IP addresses are not authorized**, then you will need to re-deploy the template and select the correct CIDR range for the EC2 based on the region you are in. This will allow you to cannect to the EC2 instance via SSH. By default, it is the allowed CIDR range for **us-west-2** region. However, if you are in the **us-east-1** region for example, the CIDR range will need to be **18.206.107.24/29** when deploying the AWS Cloudformation template. Additional CIDR ranges for each region can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joetek/aws-ip-ranges-json/refs/heads/master/ip-ranges-ec2-instance-connect.json).

![ec2 ssh error](images/ec2_ssh_error.gif)

- Next, use the following command to edit the invoke_agent.py file:

  ```bash
  sudo vi app/streamlit_app/invoke_agent.py
  ```

- Press **_i_** to go into edit mode. Then, update the **_AGENT ID_** and **_Agent ALIAS ID_** values.

![file_edit](images/file_edit.png)

- After, hit `Esc`, then save the file changes with the following command:

  ```bash
  :wq!
  ```

- Now, start the streamlit app by running the following command:

  ```bash
  streamlit run app/streamlit_app/app.py
  ```

- You should see an external URL. Copy & paste the URL into a web browser to start the streamlit application.

![External IP](images/external_ip.png)

- Once the app is running, please test some of the sample prompts provided. (On 1st try, if you receive an error, try again.)

![Running App ](images/running_app.png)

- Optionally, you can review the [trace events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/trace-events.html) in the left toggle of the screen. This data will include the **Preprocessing, Orchestration**, and **PostProcessing** traces.

![Trace events ](images/trace_events.png)
